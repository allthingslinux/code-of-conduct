This is a Safe for Work (SFW) environment, which strictly prohibits Not
Safe for Work (NSFW) content and discussions. NSFW usually refers to
sexually explicit content, however the definition is expanding to
include a broader range of sensitive topics over time. Although Discord
allows servers to create designated NSFW channels, it's worth noting
that this platform does not offer such channels.

Your content must not be sexually explicit, it must also not contain
excessive violence towards anything and anyone including yourself,
regardless on whether it is fictional or not. Content that intends
to shock, disturb and incite harm is also prohibited. This also means
that glorification, promotion and normalization of any form of harm,
especially when used for coercion and emotional manipulation.

Members must be at least 13 years old, in line with Discord's Terms of
Service. Our server assumes all members meet this age requirement,
though we do not verify ages.

We also cannot verify that members are over the age of 18+, so we
implore that members treat everyone as if they are 13-17 year old. A
user may state otherwise with sufficient proof, but it still will not
condone mature behaviour in public channels outside of direct messages.

We only condone platonic and professional interactions in the server. We
forbid all but not limited to soliciting sexual or romantic
relationships or content of the same nature, using suggestive language
or innuendos and participating in predatory behaviour towards all age
groups. We also do not condone sexual topics that can discomfort minors,
neither do we allow unconsentually sharing personal information.
Bypassing the rules to allow for this type of behaviour is especially
prohibited.

We place the safety of minors among the highest priorities, and as such,
we will promptly investigate any behaviour that will undermine such
safety. Moderation should be immediately alerted upon inappropriate
behaviour in regards to minors. This marks pedophilia apologism as a
threat and will therefore bring heavy repercussions, regardless of age
claims, given sufficient context.
