description = """
All server rules apply in every channel, including both text and voice.

2.2.a - Chat Quality
Avoid spam, low-effort or “brainrot” messages (often abbrivated to LQ or low quality), inchorent text, animal sounds, disruptive speech, or otherwise obnoxious behavior. Contribute meaningfully and with substantial value.

2.2.b – Voice Channels
Etiquette in voice chat is different than how text may be approached, but please keep these in mind:
* Keep noise minimal (mute when afk, minimize yelling and echoing)
* Use side chat for notes and discussion instead of a regular channel
* Don’t interrupt or dominate discussions

2.2.c – Channel Use
Please stay on topic and in the right channel. Check channel description if you’re unsure. Avoid misusing bots and applications, bots should be either in #dj-booth, side chats, or #bot-commands.
Avoid derailing ongoing discussions or misusing channels that have a specific purpose, such as the support channels. Moderators may suddenly change topics only in cases where it’s on the verge of being rule-breaking.
