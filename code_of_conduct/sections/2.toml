Please maintain a quiet background and mute when AFK or talking to
people not in voice chat. Additionally, avoid excessive background noise
or echoing the voices of others. This can be assisted by using
closed-back headphones or earbuds.

Please maintain respect for others by waiting for your turn to talk.
Refrain from being obnoxious by keeping a normal volume and not
disturbing others. If you want to have an off topic conversation, or
grab the attention of someone else, please make another voice chat or
ping them in the voice channel you are in at the moment. This also
applies to when you initially join a voice channel.

Leave room for others to speak, try not to dominate or take over the
chat. If you want to start a different topic but there is already a
discussion, create or join another channel. Read the room before
interjecting.

Do not record voice channel conversations without consent. If a rule
violation occurs during a voice call, you may request permission to
record by opening a ticket using `/ticket`. Any recordings must be
shared exclusively within the same ticket.

Moderators have broad discretion over enforcing voice channel
guidelines, but will act in the best interest of upholding the spirit of
the rules.
