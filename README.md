## Preface

### Discord Community Guidelines and Terms of Service

Your presence in this server implies accepting Discord’s Community Guidelines and Terms of Service, including all further changes. These changes might be done at any time with or without notice, it is your responsibility to check and follow them.

## Section 1. Essentials

### 1.1. SFW Policy

This is a Safe for Work (SFW) environment, which strictly prohibits Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and discussions. NSFW usually refers to sexually explicit content, but the definition is expanding to include a broader range of sensitive topics over time. Although Discord allows servers to create designated NSFW channels, it's worth noting that this platform does not offer such channels.

1.1.a - Do not share sexually explicit content in messages or media.

1.1.b - Do not portray sexually explicit content in Member avatars, custom statuses, “About Me” texts, banners, emotes, stickers or any other Member profile feature/expression.

1.1.c - Do not share media depicting gore, excessive violence, or animal abuse.

1.1.d - Do not share content that glorifies, promotes, or normalizes suicide or other acts of self-harm. Self-harm acts or threats used as a form of emotional manipulation or coercion are also prohibited.

Examples of moderation expectations:

| Expectation          | Description                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mild**             | First offenses will result in Members being brought into tickets and warned. |
| **Medium**           | Warns, tickets, and timeouts ranging from 1hr-12 hours.  |
| **Severe**           | Bans are to be expected at this stage.                    |

### 1.2. Concerns of Age

Discord's age limit for usage is 13 years. Therefore, we should presume that all users here are of this minimum age. Do not automatically assume that any user is 18 or older. Furthermore, this server should not be used as a dating platform, nor should any communication involve sexually suggestive language or undertones.

### 1.3. Mutual Respect

Our server prioritizes respect for each other above all else.

Harassment of any form is strictly prohibited. Discord is designed to be a welcoming space for everyone, and harassment hinders the growth of healthy communities. Behavior, such as continuous bullying, doxxing, or raiding is not permitted.

Hate speech or any form of discriminatory conduct is not accepted here. Hate speech is defined as any expression that instigates violence or promotes prejudice against others based on their unique characteristics.

These unique characteristics include age, caste, color, disability, ethnicity, familial responsibilities, gender, gender identity, housing status, national origin, race, refugee or immigration status, religious affiliation, serious illness, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic class and status, income source, status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, or stalking, and weight and size.

Threats, whether direct, indirect, or implied, towards an individual or a group, are not tolerated.

Promoting or supporting violent extremism is also forbidden. Glorifying violent incidents, supporting those who perpetrate violent acts, or promoting conspiracy theories that may incite violence towards others, are all prohibited.

Examples of moderation expectations:

| Expectation          | Description                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mild**             | Pulling Members into tickets and requesting that            |
| **Medium**           | Reprimand within tickets and timeouts ranging from 1hr-12hr |
| **Severe**           | Severe or repeated offenses may result in bans.             |

### 1.4. Expression, Discourse and Debates

Members are free to express themselves and offer constructive criticism and input. We celebrate and encourage our diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and opinions.

However, this community upholds a model of responsible communication. While we lean into the courage of discussions, we urge members to refrain from initiating sensitive topics that might trigger conflict or perpetuate hatred, violence, or dominant ideologies.

Based on feedback from a community poll, we've decided to limit discussions on controversial topics. We believe this step will foster a more serene and inclusive environment for everyone. See here for more information: [Controversial Topics Poll](https://canary.discord.com/channels/1172245377395728464/1172343581495795752/1176257288982503474)

However, bear in mind that if any conversation is overly overly repetitive, heated, disruptive, toxic, or indecent, moderators have the discretion to, intervene, redirect, advise, or hault the conversation. These terms are not limited to a specific conversation but the mentioning of said topic. Our aim is not to suppress free speech but to keep an appropriate chatroom while promoting open, respectful, and harmonious conversations among all members.

Examples of moderation expectations:

| Expectation          | Description                                                                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mild**             | Asking Members to wrap up or end conversations.                                            |
| **Medium**           | Forcing conversations to end.                                                             |
| **Severe**           | Members with repetitive offenses may receive timeouts and be addressed in tickets within 5m to 2 hours. |

### 1.5. Avoidance of Elitism

Members should avoid disparaging others on the basis of their choices, be it their choice of operating system, desktop environment or other interests outside the main topics of the server. While friendly rivalry and banter can be elements of online communities, we don't welcome deliberate and obnoxious elitism. Respect for each other's preferences and diversity is a cardinal rule in our server.

Examples of moderation expectations:

| Expectation          | Description                                                                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mild**             | Occasional or every now and then behavior usually doesn't require active moderation.      |
| **Medium**           | If a Member is repetitively being rude or unhealthy in their behavior, Moderators may ask them to stop. |
| **Severe**           | If the behavior becomes a significant problem, Moderators may pull Members into tickets and respond accordingly based on their willingness to cooperate. |

### 1.6 Respecting Authority & Rules

Should a Moderator request you to modify your behavior, please be cooperative. In case of disagreements or errors with said moderation, we encourage you to submit a support ticket instead of publicly escalating the situation. Any rule violation should be reported via ticket, leaving the resolution to an authorized Moderator. While we discourage backseat moderating, we hope that members will help us maintain a healthy environment by guiding others if they are unaware of the rules or suggesting that certain behavior is inappropriate.

## Section 2. Participation

### 2.1. Language Requirement: English Only

The language used in this server is English only. Please use English in text, voice and support channels.

Examples of moderation expectations:

| Expectation          | Description                                                                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mild**             | Members will be kindly asked in the chat they are spreading non-english messages to keep it to english                                  |
| **Medium**           | Repeated offenses may result in Members being pulled into tickets     |
| **Severe**           | If a Member is unwilling to comply, Moderators may act as they see fit.   |

|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### 2.5. “On” and “Off” topic

* If you're unsure what a channel is for you can check the description for further details. If you're still confused you can ask in general chat, a Moderator or send in a ticket as a last resort.
* Please do not derail support threads or comment on Moderator actions in community channels. If you have concerns or questions regarding a Moderator’s actions, create a ticket to discuss the matter.

### 2.9. Doxing and Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

No doxxing other Members. Keep information about other Members private. Don’t share messages, addresses, phone numbers, social media information, or anything else about a Member without their permission. This includes people from other Discord servers.

It is of your own risk and discretion when sharing personal information to others.

## Section 3. Moderation

### 3.1. Reporting

Moderators are here to help. If there is a problem that needs Moderator attention, please create a ticket. Any and all problems are discussed as a group among Moderators. Remember nothing can be reported without concrete proof. Reporting because of rumors or hearsay is not acceptable proof. Please provide context, and searchable/linkable information as well as identifying information such as Member IDs.

### 3.2. Consistency

All rules apply to all Members, including Moderators. If the Community has reason to believe the Owner is unfit for ownership due to breaching any rules defined in this document or misusing the server outside of what is listed, the Community may request for ownership to be removed and changed.

### 3.3. Transparency

Audit Logs are visible to all server Members. Audit Logs contain a history of all changes and actions within the server as well as all Moderator actions such as punishments given to Members.

### 3.4. Enforcement

Enforcement of these rules may be done through different means. Listed below are the typical forms.

#### Hard Rules

* TODO: What should be considered as an instantly bannable offense for this server?

#### Case by Case

WIth Case by Case moderation, punishment is more subjective and dependent on the nature and frequency of transgressions. While this system gives Moderators a large amount of flexibility, accountability can be difficult due to the lack of standards and certain Moderators may punish Members differently. Because of this, all Moderator actions are free to audit and review and may require further agreement from the Moderation team.

#### Automod

Basic auto moderation will exist in this server to prevent universally severe and hateful/offensive language. If auto moderation prevents natural discussion at any point, report the issue via ticket. Additionally, basic safety and security precautions will exist to filter out harmful links and material shared within this server.

#### Mark System

* TBD: Decide if a mark system should be set in place for the server (e.g. 3 marks and you’re out)

### 3.5. Punishment

If a Member is found breaking any of these rules, 
Moderators reserve the right to give any of the following punishments depending on the severity of the offense:

* Warnings
  * Warnings act as a permanent history for Members and their behavior. Warnings should be descriptive and provide context or reason.
* Timeouts
  * TImeouts act as a temporary safeguard against in the moment disruption of the server and allow Members to “cool off” until they mitigate the current situation with a Moderator.
* Kicks
  * Kicks are typically not used within this server due to the way rule breaking is handled.
* Bans
  * Bans may either act as a temporary punishment for an allotted time frame based on the severity of the offense and the offender's history or as a permanent punishment if the Member breaks any of the server Hard Rules or has failed to show the ability to correct their behavior after a number of prior offenses.
    * TODO: Clarification is further needed on this topic.

#### Additional Actions

Additionally, Moderators reserve the right to:

* Delete any messages or posts with good reason.
* Change nicknames that violate our SFW policy or Discord ToS.
* Request for the change of any features found on a Member’s profile/server profile.
* Use their own discretion, but must justify these decisions and seek approval from their peers

### 3.6. Punishment Evasion

Members should not attempt to evade the consequences of their actions such as using an alternate account to bypass restrictions. Punishment evasion will result in an immediate ban.

### 3.7 Fairness

#### Bias

The rules defined in this document are to be reviewed and agreed upon by the Community as a whole. If a rule is unclear, it is to be revised until it is clear. If a Member believes that this document is missing any rules or exceptions, the Member may request for this addition to be reviewed and agreed upon by the Community.

In the event of a Moderator using personal best judgment when dealing with Members and punishments, all Members have the right to audit said actions and the Moderator should provide justification and or seek unanimous approval from the Moderation team.

#### Appeals

* If a Member believes their punishment is unfair, the Member can discuss their warning with the Moderation team via ticket.
* If a Member has been temporarily or permanently banned from the server and thus cannot create a ticket, the Member may reach out directly to the Moderation team for appeal.

TODO: Define an appeal process

* Add in appeals website

## Notice

Please note that this article cannot capture all rules and that each situation needs to be assessed individually. Attempting to exploit any "loopholes" within these guidelines is strictly forbidden.

These guidelines are ever-evolving, responding to varied circumstances. Hence, we might take necessary action against members or content that contradicts the core intent of these rules, even if it is not directly mentioned in the current version.

We aim to keep you updated whenever these guidelines get revised. However, the responsibility lies with you to upkeep the essence of these rules: to maintain the safety of Discord and uphold its inclusivity.  Moreover, stay informed about server announcements and polls which might induce changes to the rules. We appreciate your contribution in this regard.

Above all, exercise good judgment and common sense.
